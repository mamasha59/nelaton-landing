If you miss the scheduled catheterization, the timer will show the time that has passed since the last one. After each catheterization, go into the app and press the 'Done' button to start the countdown for the next catheterization."

We help you easily track your urination habits, which helps your doctor adjust the interval between catheterizations as needed. It's recommended to perform self-catheterization regularly throughout the day, depending on the volume of fluids you consume and your doctor's recommendations. You may need to catheterize every 4-6 hours to ensure that the urine volume in the bladder does not exceed 400 ml. If you do not catheterize frequently enough and your bladder becomes overfilled, the risk of urinary tract infections and leakage increases. Prolonged bladder stretching can cause serious damage to the kidneys."

                "title": "How much water should I drink?",
                "answer": "Adults should drink at least 1.5 liters of water a day. This is just a recommendation, and you should consult your doctor to know how much water is right for you. Remember, water is the best drink. It's recommended to avoid caffeinated drinks, as caffeine irritates the bladder. Drinking enough water helps flush the urinary system. The Nelaton app helps you track your hydration levels. You can log your water intake on the main screen using the '+Drank' button, and the 'Water Balance' screen lets you monitor your fluid intake and urine output."

                "title": "Do I need to catheterize at night?",
                "answer": "Usually, it's enough to catheterize before bed and right after waking up, then continue at intervals throughout the day. However, your doctor will advise you on what's best for you. The app helps you follow any schedule and interval of catheterization. You can set up a nighttime catheterization, follow the interval during the night, or even disable nighttime catheterization by enabling sleep mode. It all depends on your doctor's advice, and our app is ready to help you follow any schedule."

You need to specify how many catheters you have and whether you use additional supplies during catheterization (such as aseptic wipes, urine bags, gloves, etc.). This will help you keep track of how many catheters and necessary supplies you have and replenish them in time. Every time you press the 'Done' button, the app will deduct the appropriate amount of supplies. When you purchase catheters and other supplies, don't forget to update the quantity in the app."
